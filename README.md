## What is ArborShare?

Trail building volunteers care about the environment yet have difficulty organizing carpools to distant project sites- enter ArborShare- an intuitive application to manage carpooling.

### The Problem:

Currently for each project, the volunteer coordinator of a given organization maintains a spreadsheet to track which volunteers are carpooling and whether a given volunteer is looking for a ride or is driving. As a volunteer, you get an email with that spreadsheet attached and itâ€™s up to you to figure out the rest.

### Our Solution:

Users login in to the app using Google OAuth. From there, they can edit their profile, join a project carpool as either a driver or rider, and sign up for a ride. The route to pick up all the riders and get them to the project site will be available to the carpool participants once the carpool has been finalized. Upon carpool finalization, participants receive confirmation and the app provides participants with a channel to communicate any further details with each other.

### Target Audience:

Volunteers who drive to perform work on group projects, and the volunteer organizations that run such projects.
